### Potential Improvements
- **Improve SEO**: I'd love to enhance the SEO aspects, like improving meta tags, using structured data, and making the site more accessible. This would help boost our search engine rankings and reach a wider audience.

- **Enhance Caching and Revalidation Logic**: I was planning to refine the caching strategies and add smarter revalidation techniques. This would make sure users always get the latest content without compromising on performance.

- **Optimize Long Products Lists Rendering**: Handling long lists of products can be tricky. I wanted to implement virtualization or pagination to make sure everything loads quickly and smoothly, enhancing the user experience.

- **Achieve More Consistent UI**: A more cohesive design throughout the app would have been great. Tweaking the color schemes, typography, and spacing would make the UI look and feel more polished.

- **Incorporate Stunning Animations**: Adding some slick animations could really make the app pop and feel more interactive. Itâ€™s all about those little touches that make the user experience enjoyable.
